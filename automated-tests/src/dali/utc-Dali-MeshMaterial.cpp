/**
 * Test cases
 *
 * Check construction of mesh objects
 * Check downcast of mesh objects (+ve & -ve)
 * Check staging of mesh objects
 *
 * Check staging of some mesh objects but not all
 * Create geometry with no verts - ensure it asserts
 * Create an element based geometry with no indices - ensure it asserts
 * Create a renderer without a material - ensure nothing renders
 * Create a render with a material, ensure the material can be changed
 * Create a render with a material&Sampler, ensure the sampler can be changed
 * Create a render with a material, sampler, ensure the sampler's texture can be changed
 * Create a render with a material, sampler, ensure that removing the sampler works
 *
 * Blend tests:
 * 1 Set Material with translucent color, actor color opaque, Set Use image alpha to true
 *   Expect blending
 * 2 Set material to translucent, set use image alpha to false, set actor opacity to 1.0f
 *   Expect no blending
 * 3 Set material to opaque, set use image alpha to true, set actor opacity to 1.0f
 *   Expect no blending
 * 4 Set material to have image with alpha, set use image alpha to true, set actor opacity to 1.0f
 *   Expect blending
 * 5 Set material to have image with alpha, set use image alpha to false, set actor opacity to 1.0f
 *   Expect no blending
 * 6 Set material to have image without alpha, set use image alpha to true, set actor opacity to 1.0f
 *   Expect no blending
 * 7 Set material to have framebuffer with alpha, set use image alpha to true, set actor opacity to 1.0f
 *   Expect blending
 * 8 Set material to have image with alpha, set use image alpha to false, set actor opacity to 0.5f
 *   Expect blending
 * 9 Set material to have image with no alpha, set material opacity to 0.5, set use image alpha to true, set actor opacity to 1.0f
 *   Expect blending
 *
 * Check defaults of renderer
 *
 * Bounding box of geometry?
 *
 * Check rendered vertex buffer is the right size for the initial property buffer
 *
 * Check PropertyBuffer set via SetData can be read thru property system
 * Check PropertyBuffer property setters / getters
 * Check vertex PropertyBuffer set via properties renders as expected
 * Check Index propertyBuffer set via properties renders as expected
 *
 * Check geometry type renders correctly as the matching GL draw call and type
 *
 * Check attributes change when rendering different actors with different
 * vertex formats (utc-Dali-Context.cpp)
 *
 * utc-Dali-Material.cpp
 * Check material color affects output - see shader uniform
 *
 * Check material sampler's image load/release policies affect rendering correctly.
