/**
 * @brief An actor for displaying images.
 *
 * Allows the developer to add an actor to stage which displays the content of an Image object.
 *
 * By default CullFaceMode is set to CullNone to enable the ImageActor to be viewed from all angles.
 *
 * If an ImageActor is created without setting size, then the actor takes the size of the image -
 * this is the natural size.
 * Setting a size on the ImageActor, e.g through the SetSize api or through an animation will
 * stop the natural size being used.
 *
 * If a pixel area is set on an ImageActor with natural size, the actor size will change
 * to match the pixel area. If a pixel area is set on an ImageActor that has had it's size set,
 * then the size doesn't change, and the partial image will be stretched to fill the set size.
 *
 * Clearing the pixel area on an Image actor with natural size will cause the actor to show the
 * whole image again, and will change size back to that of the image.
 *
 * Clearing the pixel area on an Image actor with a set size will cause the actor to show the
 * whole image again, but will not change the image size.
