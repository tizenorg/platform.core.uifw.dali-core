 * stored in them. This means it is up to the client to construct/destruct objects
 * and hence determine what data type is stored in the memory block. See FixedSizeObjectAllocator
 * below for an example client for creating objects of a given type. It is also up to the client
 * to ensure that the size of the block takes memory alignment into account for the
 * type of data they wish to store in the block. The TypeSizeWithAlignment<T> template
 * can be useful for determining the size of memory aligned blocks for a given type.
