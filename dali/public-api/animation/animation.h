/**
 * @brief Dali::Animation can be used to animate the properties of any number of objects, typically Actors.
 *
 * An example animation setup is shown below:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * struct MyProgram
 * {
 *   Actor mActor; // The object we wish to animate
 *   Animation mAnimation; // Keep this to control the animation
 * }
 *
 * // ...To play the animation
 *
 * mAnimation = Animation::New(3.0f); // duration 3 seconds
 * mAnimation.AnimateTo(Property(mActor, Actor::Property::POSITION), Vector3(10.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f));
 * mAnimation.Play();
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * Dali::Animation supports "fire and forget" behaviour i.e. an animation continues to play if the handle is discarded.
 * Note that in the following example, the "Finish" signal will be emitted:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * void ExampleCallback( Animation& source )
 * {
 *   std::cout << "Animation has finished" << std::endl;
 * }
 *
 * void ExampleAnimation( Actor actor )
 * {
 *   Animation animation = Animation::New(2.0f); // duration 2 seconds
 *   animation.AnimateTo(Property(actor, Actor::Property::POSITION), 10.0f, 50.0f, 0.0f);
 *   animation.FinishedSignal().Connect( ExampleCallback );
 *   animation.Play();
 * } // At this point the animation handle has gone out of scope
 *
 * Actor actor = Actor::New();
 * Stage::GetCurrent().Add( actor );
 *
 * // Fire animation and forget about it
 * ExampleAnimation( actor );
 *
 * // However the animation will continue, and "Animation has finished" will be printed after 2 seconds.
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * If the "Finish" signal is connected to a member function of an object, it must be disconnected before the object is destroyed.
 * This is typically done in the object destructor, and requires either the Dali::Connection object or Dali::Animation handle to be stored.
 *
 * Signals
 * | %Signal Name | Method                   |
 * |--------------|--------------------------|
 * | finished     | @ref FinishedSignal()    |
 *
 * Actions
 * | %Action Name | %Animation method called |
 * |--------------|--------------------------|
 * | play         | Play()                   |
 * | stop         | Stop()                   |
 * | pause        | Pause()                  |
