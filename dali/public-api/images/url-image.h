/**
 * @brief UrlImage is an image loaded using a URL
 *
 * <h3>UrlImage Loading</h3>
 *
 * When the UrlImage is created, resource loading will be attempted unless
 * the UrlImage is created with ON_DEMAND loading policy or a compatible resource is found in cache.
 * In case of loading images on demand, resource loading will only be attempted if the associated ImageActor
 * is put on Stage.
 * Custom loading requests can be made by providing an ImageAttributes object to UrlImage::New().
 *
 * <i>LoadPolicies</i>
 * - IMMEDIATE: acquire image resource when creating UrlImage.
 * - ON_DEMAND: only load in case the associated ImageActor is put on Stage
 *
 * <i>Resolution of conflicting policies</i>
 * If the same image is created more than once with conflicting policies, LoadPolicy "IMMEDIATE" overrides "ON_DEMAND".
 *
 * <i>Custom load requests</i>
 * Size, scaling mode, orientation compensation can be set when requesting an image.
 * See ImageAttributes for more details.
 *
 * <i>Compatible resources</i>
 *
 * Before loading a new UrlImage the internal image resource cache is checked by dali.
 * If there is an image already loaded in memory and is deemed "compatible" with the requested image,
 * that resource is reused.
 * This happens for example if a loaded image exists with the same URL, and the difference between both
 * of the dimensions is less than 50%.
 *
 * <i>Reloading images</i>
 *
 * The same request used on creating the UrlImage is re-issued when reloading images.
 * If the file changed since the last load operation, this might result in a different resource.
 * Reload only takes effect if both of these conditions apply:
 * - The UrlImage has already finished loading
 * - The UrlImage is either on Stage or using IMMEDIATE load policy
