/**
 * @brief Actor is the primary object with which Dali applications interact.
 *
 * UI controls can be built by combining multiple actors.
 *
 * <h3>Multi-Touch Events:</h3>
 *
 * Touch or hover events are received via signals; see Actor::TouchedSignal() and Actor::HoveredSignal() for more details.
 *
 * <i>Hit Testing Rules Summary:</i>
 *
 * - An actor is only hittable if the actor's touch or hover signal has a connection.
 * - An actor is only hittable when it is between the camera's near and far planes.
 * - If an actor is made insensitive, then the actor and its children are not hittable; see IsSensitive()
 * - If an actor's visibility flag is unset, then none of its children are hittable either; see IsVisible()
 * - To be hittable, an actor must have a non-zero size.
 * - If an actor's world color is fully transparent, then it is not hittable; see GetCurrentWorldColor()
 *
 * <i>Hit Test Algorithm:</i>
 *
 * - Stage
 *   - Gets the first down and the last up touch events to the screen, regardless of actor touch event consumption.
 *   - Stage's root layer can be used to catch unconsumed touch events.
 *
 * - RenderTasks
 *   - Hit testing is dependent on the camera used, which is specific to each RenderTask.
 *
 * - Layers
 *   - For each RenderTask, hit testing starts from the top-most layer and we go through all the
 *     layers until we have a hit or there are none left.
 *   - Before we perform a hit test within a layer, we check if all the layer's parents are visible
 *     and sensitive.
 *   - If they are not, we skip hit testing the actors in that layer altogether.
 *   - If a layer is set to consume all touch, then we do not check any layers behind this layer.
 *
 * - Actors
 *   - The final part of hit testing is performed by walking through the actor tree within a layer.
 *   - The following pseudocode shows the algorithm used:
 *     @code
 *     HIT-TEST-WITHIN-LAYER( ACTOR )
 *     {
 *       // Only hit-test the actor and its children if it is sensitive and visible
 *       IF ( ACTOR-IS-SENSITIVE &&
 *            ACTOR-IS-VISIBLE )
 *       {
 *         // Depth-first traversal within current layer, visiting parent first
 *
 *         // Check whether current actor should be hit-tested
 *         IF ( ( TOUCH-SIGNAL-NOT-EMPTY || HOVER-SIGNAL-NOT-EMPTY ) &&
 *              ACTOR-HAS-NON-ZERO-SIZE &&
 *              ACTOR-WORLD-COLOR-IS-NOT-TRANSPARENT )
 *         {
 *           // Hit-test current actor
 *           IF ( ACTOR-HIT )
 *           {
 *             IF ( ACTOR-IS-OVERLAY || ( DISTANCE-TO-ACTOR < DISTANCE-TO-LAST-HIT-ACTOR ) )
 *             {
 *               // The current actor is the closest actor that was underneath the touch
 *               LAST-HIT-ACTOR = CURRENT-ACTOR
 *             }
 *           }
 *         }
 *
 *         // Keep checking children, in case we hit something closer
 *         FOR-EACH CHILD (in order)
 *         {
 *           IF ( CHILD-IS-NOT-A-LAYER )
 *           {
 *             // Continue traversal for this child's sub-tree
 *             HIT-TEST-WITHIN-LAYER ( CHILD )
 *           }
 *           // else we skip hit-testing the child's sub-tree altogether
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *     @endcode
 *   - Overlays always take priority (i.e. they're considered closer) regardless of distance.
 *     The overlay children take priority over their parents, and overlay siblings take priority
 *     over their previous siblings (i.e. reverse of rendering order):
 *     @code
 *           1
 *          / \
 *         /   \
 *        2     5
 *       / \     \
 *      /   \     \
 *     3     4     6
 *
 *     Hit Priority of above Actor tree (all overlays): 1 - Lowest. 6 - Highest.
 *     @endcode
 *   - Stencil Actors can be used to influence the result of hits on renderable actors within a layer.
 *     If a Stencil Actor exists on a layer and that Actor is marked visible then a successful
 *     hit on a renderable actor can only take place in the area that the stencil Actor marks as visible.
 *     The hit can be in any Stencil Actor in that layer, but must be in the region of one of them.
 *     Stencil Actor inheritance behaves as with rendering in that any child of a Stencil Actor will
 *     also be considered a Stencil Actor.
 *     Non-renderable actors can be hit regardless of whether a stencil actor is hit or not.
 *
 * <i>Touch or hover Event Delivery:</i>
 *
 * - Delivery
 *   - The hit actor's touch or hover signal is emitted first; if it is not consumed by any of the listeners,
 *     the parent's touch or hover signal is emitted, and so on.
 *   - The following pseudocode shows the delivery mechanism:
 *     @code
 *     EMIT-TOUCH-SIGNAL( ACTOR )
 *     {
 *       IF ( TOUCH-SIGNAL-NOT-EMPTY )
 *       {
 *         // Only do the emission if touch signal of actor has connections.
 *         CONSUMED = TOUCHED-SIGNAL( TOUCH-EVENT )
 *       }
 *
 *       IF ( NOT-CONSUMED )
 *       {
 *         // If event is not consumed then deliver it to the parent unless we reach the root actor
 *         IF ( ACTOR-PARENT )
 *         {
 *           EMIT-TOUCH-SIGNAL( ACTOR-PARENT )
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     EMIT-HOVER-SIGNAL( ACTOR )
 *     {
 *       IF ( HOVER-SIGNAL-NOT-EMPTY )
 *       {
 *         // Only do the emission if hover signal of actor has connections.
 *         CONSUMED = HOVERED-SIGNAL( HOVER-EVENT )
 *       }
 *
 *       IF ( NOT-CONSUMED )
 *       {
 *         // If event is not consumed then deliver it to the parent unless we reach the root actor
 *         IF ( ACTOR-PARENT )
 *         {
 *           EMIT-HOVER-SIGNAL( ACTOR-PARENT )
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *     @endcode
 *   - If there are several touch points, then the delivery is only to the first touch point's hit
 *     actor (and its parents).  There will be NO touch or hover signal delivery for the hit actors of the
 *     other touch points.
 *   - The local coordinates are from the top-left (0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f) of the hit actor.
 *
 * - Leave State
 *   - A "Leave" state is set when the first point exits the bounds of the previous first point's
 *     hit actor (primary hit actor).
 *   - When this happens, the last primary hit actor's touch or hover signal is emitted with a "Leave" state
 *     (only if it requires leave signals); see SetLeaveRequired().
 *
 * - Interrupted State
 *   - If a system event occurs which interrupts the touch or hover processing, then the last primary hit
 *     actor's touch or hover signals are emitted with an "Interrupted" state.
 *   - If the last primary hit actor, or one of its parents, is no longer touchable or hoverable, then its
 *     touch or hover signals are also emitted with an "Interrupted" state.
 *   - If the consumed actor on touch-down is not the same as the consumed actor on touch-up, then
 *     touch signals are also emitted from the touch-down actor with an "Interrupted" state.
 *   - If the consumed actor on hover-start is not the same as the consumed actor on hover-finished, then
 *     hover signals are also emitted from the hover-started actor with an "Interrupted" state.
 * <h3>Key Events:</h3>
 *
 * Key events are received by an actor once set to grab key events, only one actor can be set as focused.
