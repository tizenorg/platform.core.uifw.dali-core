/**
 * @brief An Image object represents an image resource that can be added to ImageActors.
 *
 * Image objects can also handle custom requests for image loading and are responsible for
 * the underlying resource's lifetime.
 *
 * <h3>Image Loading</h3>
 *
 * When the Image object is created, resource loading will be attempted unless
 * the Image object is created with OnDemand loading policy or a compatible resource is found in cache.
 * In case of loading images on demand, resource loading will only be attempted if the associated ImageActor
 * is put on Stage.
 * Custom loading requests can be made by providing an ImageAttributes object to Image::New().
 *
 * <i>LoadPolicies</i>
 * - Immediate: acquire image resource when creating Image object.
 * - OnDemand: only load in case the associated ImageActor is put on Stage
 *
 * <i>ReleasePolicies</i>
 * - Unused: release resource once ImageActor using it is taken off stage.
 * - Never: keep resource alive until Image object is thrown away.
 *
 * <i>Resolution of conflicting policies</i>
 * If the same image is created more than once with conflicting policies, LoadPolicy "Immediate" overrides "OnDemand"
 * and ReleasePolicy "Never" overrides "Unused".
 *
 * <i>Custom load requests</i>
 * Size, scaling mode, orientation compensation can be set when requesting an image resource.
 * See ImageAttributes for more details.
 *
 * <i>Compatible resources</i>
 *
 * Before loading a new image the internal image resource cache is checked by dali.
 * If there is an Image already loaded in memory and is deemed "compatible" with the requested Image,
 * that resource is reused.
 * This happens for example if a loaded image exists with the same filename, and the difference between both
 * of the dimensions is less than 50%.
 *
 * <i>Reloading Images</i>
 *
 * The same request used on creating the Image is re-issued when reloading Images.
 * If the file changed since the last load operation, this might result in a different resource.
 * Reload only takes effect if both of these conditions apply:
 * - The Image has already finished loading
 * - The Image is either on Stage or using Immediate load policy
 *
 * <h3>Image resource lifetime</h3>
 *
 * Image objects can be shared between ImageActors. This is practical if you have a visual element on screen
 * which is repeatedly used. An example would be a button background image.
 * The image resource is discarded when all ImageActors using the Image object are discarded or in case they
 * were created with ReleasePolicy::Unused, taken off stage.
 * Note: if a resource was shared between Image objects it exists until its last reference is gone.
 *
