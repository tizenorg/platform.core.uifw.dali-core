 * @brief NinePatchImage represents a stretchable image resource
 *
 * It contains a bitmap that is synchronously loaded from the file system that contains
 * a 9 patch border - a 1 pixel border that describes the stretch borders and the child
 * area.
 *
 * The class offers an API to read the stretch area and child area, but it does not
 * remove the border from it's bitmap. An API can be used to obtain a BufferImage with
 * the border removed.
 *
 * Adding this image to an ImageActor using an Image handle will automatically convert
 * to use the cropped BufferImage - if you don't retain a handle to this object, it will
 * be automatically destroyed.
