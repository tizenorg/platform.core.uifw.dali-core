Automatic Shader String Generation
----------------------------------

 - The filename of the shaders determines the strings that are generated.
 - Ensure your shader is named according to the following rules:
   - All lowercase.
   - Word separation using "-".
   - Suffix should be ".txt".
   - For example: "my-new-shader.txt".
 - Both the vertex and the fragment shader should be stored in the same text file.
 - The vertex shader should be encapsulated within "<VertexShader>" and "</VertexShader>".
 - The fragment shader should be encapsulated within "<FragmentShader>" and "</FragmentShader>".
 - A header and a source file will be automatically generated using this information.
   - They will contain several string constants.
   - The generated strings will be in camel case using the dashes to separate out the words.
     - e.g, for "my-new-shader.txt", we will get "MyNewShaderVertex" & "MyNewShaderFragment".
 - When you wish to use these strings in your code, you should include the file "dali-shaders.h".
