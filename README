1. GBS Builds
=============

1.1. NON-SMACK Targets
----------------------

 gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH]

1.2. SMACK enabled Targets
--------------------------

 gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH] --define "%enable_dali_smack_rules 1"



2. Building for Ubuntu desktop
==============================

2.1. Minimum Requirements
------------------------

 - Ubuntu 14.04

2.2. Creating a DALi Environment
-------------------------------

To build for desktop first ensure ALL sources are selected:
 - Go to Ubuntu Settings and then to "Software & Updates"
 - In the "Ubuntu Software" tab, ensure ALL software sources are ticked
   (This is required because we install some community-maintained free & open-source software)

Then you can create a dali-env folder in your home folder with:

 dali-core/build/scripts/dali_env -c

This will also download any dependencies that the dali repositories require.

You can save the environment variables to a file:

 dali-env/opt/bin/dali_env -s > setenv

This process only needs to be done once.

Next source these variables:

 . setenv

You will have to source these variables every time you open up a new terminal (or you can add to .bashrc if you prefer).

2.3. Building the Repository
----------------------------

To build the repository enter the 'build/tizen' folder:

 cd dali-core/build/tizen

Then run the following commands:

 autoreconf --install
 ./configure --prefix=$DESKTOP_PREFIX
 make install -j8
