/**
 * @brief BufferImage represents an image resource that can be added to ImageActors.
 * Its pixel buffer data is provided by the application developer.
 *
 * Care should be taken with pixel data allocated by the application,
 * as the data is copied to GL both when the image is added to the
 * stage and after a call to Update().  In both of these cases, a
 * SignalUploaded will be sent to the application confirming that the
 * operation has completed.
 *
 * The application can free the pixel data after receiving a
 * SignalUploaded.
 *
 * Similarly, once the image is on stage (i.e. it's being used by an
 * ImageActor that is on stage), the application should only write to
 * the buffer after receiving a SignalUploaded, then call Update()
 * once the write is finished. This avoids the pixel data being changed
 * whilst it's being copied to GL. Writing to the buffer without waiting
 * for the signal will likely result in visible tearing.
 *
 * If the pixel format of the pixel buffer contains an alpha channel,
 * then the image is considered to be have transparent pixels without
 * regard for the actual content of the channel, and will be blended.
 *
 * If the image is opaque and blending is not required, then the user
 * should call ImageActor::SetUseImageAlpha(false) on the containing actor.
