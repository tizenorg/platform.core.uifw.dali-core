 * @DEPRECATED_1_1.11
 * @brief An actor for displaying images.
 *
 * Allows the developer to add an actor to stage which displays the content of an Image object.
 *
 * By default ImageActor can be viewed from all angles.
 *
 * If an ImageActor is created without setting size, then the actor takes the size of the image -
 * this is the natural size.
 * Setting a size on the ImageActor, e.g through the @ref Actor::SetSize api or through an animation will
 * stop the natural size being used.
 *

 * @remarks This is an experimental feature and might not be supported in the next release. We do recommend not to use it. Use of ImageActor should be avoided unless shader effects need to be applied.
 * For general purpose, use Toolkit::ImageView which has much better performance.
