/**
 * @brief An Image object represents an image resource that can be added to ImageActors.
 *
 * Image objects can be shared between ImageActors. This is practical if you have a visual element on screen
 * which is repeatedly used. An example would be a button background image.
 * The image resource is discarded when all ImageActors using the Image object are discarded or in case they
 * were created with ReleasePolicy::Unused, taken off stage.
 * Note: if a resource was shared between Image objects it exists until its last reference is gone.
 *
 * Image objects are responsible for the underlying resource's lifetime.
 *
 * <i>ReleasePolicies</i>
 * - Unused: release resource once ImageActor using it is taken off stage.
 * - Never: keep resource alive until Image object is thrown away.
 *
 * <i>Resolution of conflicting policies</i>
 * If the same image is created more than once with conflicting policies, ReleasePolicy "Never" overrides "Unused".
