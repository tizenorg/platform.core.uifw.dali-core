/**
 * @brief EncodedBufferImage represents an image resource that can be added to
 * ImageActors.
 *
 * A memory buffer of encoded image data is provided by the application and
 * decoded asynchronously on a background thread to fill the image's
 * pixel data.
 *
 * The buffer of data provided to an EncodedBufferImage factory function
 * (New) should be filled with encoded image data in one of %Dali's
 * supported image file formats, with the sequence of bytes in the buffer
 * exactly matching the sequence of bytes that a file in the file system
 * holding the encoded image data would have.
 *
 * The application may free the encoded image buffer passed to one of the
 * New() static factory member functions as soon as they return.
 *
 * <h3> Signals </h3>
 *
 * Image::LoadingFinishedSignal is emitted when the decoding of the
 * image data is completed, either successfully or not.
 *
 * Image::UploadedSignal is emitted when the decoded image data gets
 * uploaded to the OpenGL ES implementation.
