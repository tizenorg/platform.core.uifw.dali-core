/**
 * @brief Describes Image properties like dimensions and pixel format and
 * operations to be applied to images during the load process.
 *
 * ImageAttributes is used to define a set of properties of an image and a
 * sequence of operations to be applied when loading it.
 *
 * The overall order of operations which can be applied is:
 *   1. Determine the desired dimensions for the final bitmap.
 *   2. Scale the image to fit the desired dimensions.
 *
 * The default for each stage is to do nothing.
 * To enable a calculation of desired final image dimensions and fitting to it, SetSize() must be called.
 *
 * The loader does not guarantee to rescale a loaded image to the exact desired dimensions, but it will make a best effort to downscale images.
 * The fitting to destination dimensions controlled by the ScalingMode may choose to fit to a larger area with an equivalent aspect ratio.
 * If the requested dimensions are larger than the loaded ones, it will never upscale on load to fill them but will instead fit to smaller dimensions of identical aspect ratio.
 * This is transparent to an application as the upscaling can happen during rendering.
 *
 * To enable scaling of images on load, desired dimensions must be set using SetSize().
 * Only one of the dimensions need be supplied, in which case, the other is calculated based on the aspect ratio of the raw loaded image.
 * The desired dimensions 2-tuple 'd' is determined as follows for loaded image dimensions 'l' and 's', the dimensions tuple set with SetSize():
 *   *  `d = s, if s.x != 0 & s.y != 0, else:`
 *   *  `d = [s.x, s.x * (l.y / l.x)], if s.x != 0 & s.y = 0, else:`
 *   *  `d = [s.y * (l.x / l.y), s.y], if s.x = 0 & s.y != 0, else:`
 *   *  `d = l, otherwise.`
 *
 * Use cases for scaling images on load include:
 *   1. Full-screen image display: Limit loaded image resolution to device resolution using ShrinkToFit mode.
 *   2. Thumbnail gallery grid: Limit loaded image resolution to screen tile using ScaleToFill mode.
 *   3. Image columns: Limit loaded image resolution to column width using FitWidth mode.
 *   4. Image rows: Limit loaded image resolution to row height using FitHeight mode.
 *
 * @note The aspect ratio of image contents is preserved by all scaling modes, so for example squares in input images stay square after loading.
